== Description ==

**Simple Youtube Shortcode** provides a shortcode to embed youtube videos or playlists, with basic options for sizing the player and styling with CSS. I needed a shortcode to simplify the task of embedding a YouTube video player into my website, allowing both single videos or playlists, with options for resizing and styling the player. 
Simple Youtube Shortcode is the result. It does exactly that, and nothing more.

= USAGE: = 
**Embed a single video:**

	[embed_youtube src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/4r7wHMg5Yjg"  width="300" height="200" class="youtubestyle" id="thisid"]

**Embed a play list:**

	[embed_youtube src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/videoseries?list=PLBED6EEEFDDD630FA&amp;hl=en_US"  width="60%" ]

**Pass parameters to the YouTube player to change its behavior:**

	[embed_youtube src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/4r7wHMg5Yjg?modestbranding=1&autohide=1&showinfo=0&rel=0&start=35"  width = "200" height="150" class="styleme"]
